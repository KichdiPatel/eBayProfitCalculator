# Ebay Profit Calculator

As a eBay reseller, sourcing is a very tedious process. So, this eBay Profit Calculator is a way to speed up one aspect of that process. It is a program you can run through the command line where you input the keywords of the product you want to research, and the program will scrape the eBay sold listings for that keyword with other additional parameters that I tweak based on my selling style. As an output, the program will provide an average selling price with outliers removed since the sold listings page is naturally not always correct. 

Hope you can benefit from this!
